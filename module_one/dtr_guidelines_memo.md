# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation. 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
* How would you describe your work style?
* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
* How will we overcome obstacles?
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

### Template for DTR Memo

Project: 

Group Member Names:

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project? 

* Eliot: Learn the basics of Active Record, more familiarity with HTTP verbs and erb files

* Zach: Fluency in active record and proficiency in HTML and css. Basic server tools and setup.

* Jamison: To not suck at HTML and css by the time we’re done. Get familiar with the tools used to set up the server. 

* Use waffle for workload division


Goals and expectations:
* Expectations:  Communication 
		            COMPLETION!!!
			Comradery
			Commit after every smallest unit of meaningful code
			

* Goal:	 Aim for an extra extension
         	 It  look presentable
         	 Balanced Commits

	
Team strengths: Strategic Thinking, Planning, Git workflow


How to overcome obstacles:
Get help early, get help often
Pairing


Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
* Eliot: Thursday and Tuesday, can’t stay late. Can’t meet Saturday

* Jamison: can stay til 7 usually, Tuesday and Thursday can’t stay late, can’t meet Sunday

* Zach: has to leave by six on Wednesday 


Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):


* Jamison slack hours: 7am to 8pm
Eliot slack hours: 8am to 10-11pm
Zach slack hours: 7am to 12 pm


* Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

* Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Eliot: Merchants (iteration 1, 2)
Jamison: Items (iteration 3, 4)
Zach: Invoices (iteration 5, 6)

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): 
Git commit message conventions:
	‘TESTS’ indicates the writing of a test which does not yet correspond to any code
	‘WIP’ indicates that a block of code is not complete 
	‘Implements’ indicates the writing of a block of code for which a TEST was just written
	‘tests’ some method which already exists (the devil)
	Ex: TESTS some method WIP
	       Implements some method 
	       Implements some method WIP

Use Agile effictively:
	Sprint 1: iterations 1 - 6 
		Divided workload
			2 iterations each
	Sprint 2: Logic iterations
		Defines relationships between databases
	Sprint 3: Front facing interactions
		User Testing 
		Take feedback from a variety of users
	Sprint 4: Reacting to feedback
		Respond to previous sprint feedback and remodel
Sprint 5: Final Extensions
	Pick two extensions
	User test Extensions
	Respond to feedback


Will assign more after first sprint




Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  Specific 
	Actionable 
	Kind


Agenda to discuss project launch:

Ideas:
In deployment to heroku, build up a server on our local machine which only holds csv files and the postgresql tables, so that the heroku app will be able to access the entirety of the data set without storing anything. 

 
Tools: 
Git hub
Sinatra
Waffle.io
Google Docs
Rubocop
